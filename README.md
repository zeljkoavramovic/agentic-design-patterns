# Agentic Design Patterns

This repository contains an interactive, single-file tutorial on 22 essential agentic design patterns for building intelligent AI systems.



## Overview

The included `index.html` file is a self-contained web page that provides a comprehensive guide to various patterns used in modern AI development. It's designed to make complex architectural concepts accessible through simple visual representations, detailed explanations, and real-world examples.

### Online Use
Open https://zeljkoavramovic.github.io/agentic-design-patterns/ in your browser.

### Offline Use
Simply download the `index.html` file and open it in any modern web browser. No internet connection is required after the initial download.



## Pattern Relationships

The following diagram illustrates how different agentic patterns often connect and rely on each other. This provides a high-level view of the ecosystem.
